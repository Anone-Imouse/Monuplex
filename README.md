# Monuplex
Monuplex is an extension based on Lab simulation with features like magnifying glass, seringe, notebook, etc. It includes a one-time $3 CAD fee to start.  The seringe can help get your color on screen and the magnifying glass will magnify many times any points onscreen. The notebook allows you to draw onscreen while recording audio or video.
